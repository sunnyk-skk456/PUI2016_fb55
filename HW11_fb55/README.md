Please name your directory HW11_\<netID> (even if you are in the Wednesday cohort and this is your 12th assignment)


IMPORTANT NOTE: on this homework on you are graded on PEP8 compliance as well!

Use https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2016_fb55/blob/master/PEP8MinimalRequirements.md as a guideline.

## ASSIGNED READING:

[Don't use Hadoop - your data isn't that big](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html), Chris Stucchio

### Submission Info:

For Assignment 1 and 2 : work in groups as usal, and you are encouraged to work in groups. Create a HW11_ directory in your PUI2016_ repository. Include a README.md that briefly summarizes the scope of the homework (so we know you understand what you did), and states with whome you worked and what you specifically contributed to.

Submit Assignment 1 and 2 as notebooks. Please dont just download my notebook, leave instructions in and fill in code cells: make it a presentation, comment on what you see, in English, with full sentences, and use critical thinking!!

Keep in mind that we will look for possible cases of plagiarism, and if the code appears too similar to that of people that you did not work with to be original work (there are automated ways to look for plagiarism in code) you will be penalized.

## ASSIGNMENTS:


THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME FOR GETTING AND CRUNCHING DATA! DON'T START ON THE LAST DAY!

### Assignment 1: 

Follow notebook instructions. Be careful! the geopandas dataframe for census tracks is VERY large. If you try and plot it all you are likely to crush your computer. Work only with what you need.

### Assignment 2:

Follow notebook instructions. There are many buisiness datasets that need to be downloaded and that takes time. Clustering often takes time, particularly hierarchical clustering. Dont start at the last minute!

Note that the link to the zipcodes geofile is broken right now. The file was uploaded in the repository because of that.
